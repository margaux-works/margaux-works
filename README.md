🦉 When I'm not coding you can find me:

- 🚴‍♀️ Cycling through Berlin’s streets or enjoying indoor cycling classes (in the dark, with loud techno music and a coach screaming at me).<br/> 
- 🦅 Exploring nature and indulging in amateur birdwatching.<br/>
- 🔍 Watching true crime documentaries or tackling challenging puzzles during the winter months.<br/>
